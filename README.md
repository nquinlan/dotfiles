# dotfiles
_"Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine."_

This is the start to my dotfiles repo. There will be significant changes.

Currently, my dotfiles just make settings, although I'm considering having them further provision my system: installing applications, executables and the like.

## Install
To install `dotfiles`, clone this repository to `~/.dotfiles`

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nquinlan/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then, run `bootstrap.sh`

```sh
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```
